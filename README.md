# Electronic Prescription Management System

Project Description:
Develop an electronic prescription management system that allows healthcare professionals to create, manage, and securely transmit prescription information to pharmacies and patients. This system should be designed to streamline the prescription process, enhance patient safety, and maintain compliance with medical regulations.

Key Features:

User Authentication: Implement secure user authentication for healthcare professionals, pharmacists, and patients.

Prescription Creation: Allow healthcare professionals (doctors, nurses, etc.) to create electronic prescriptions for patients. Each prescription should include patient details, medication information (name, dosage, frequency), diagnosis, and doctor's notes.

Medication Database: Maintain a database of medications with details such as generic names, brand names, dosage forms, and side effects. Healthcare professionals should be able to search and select medications when creating prescriptions.

Patient Management: Enable healthcare professionals to manage patient records, including personal information, medical history, and prescription history.

Prescription Verification: Implement a feature for pharmacists to verify prescriptions received electronically. Pharmacists should have the ability to review the prescription details, confirm its validity, and dispense medication accordingly.

Prescription History: Allow patients to access their prescription history, view active prescriptions, and receive notifications when a new prescription is issued or needs a refill.

Notifications and Reminders: Provide notifications to patients for medication reminders and scheduled appointments.

Data Backup and Recovery: Implement a robust data backup and recovery system to prevent data loss.
